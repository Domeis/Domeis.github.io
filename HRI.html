    <h1>Human-Robot Interaction</h1>
    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>The study investigated the role of humanoid robots’ body language on perceptions of social qualities and
        human-likeness in robots. In experiment 1, videos of a robot’s body language varying in expansiveness were used
        to evaluate the two aspects. In experiment 2, videos of social interactions containing the body languages in
        experiment 1 were used to further examine the effects of robots’ body language on these aspects. Results suggest
        that a robot conveying open body language are evaluated higher on perceptions of social characteristics and
        human-likeness compared to a robot with closed body language. These effects were not found in videos of social
        interactions (experiment 2), which suggests that other features play significant roles in evaluations of a
        robot. Nonetheless, current research provides evidence of the importance of robots’ body language in judgments
        of social characteristics and human-likeness. </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>This project was my Master's Thesis. The robot industries are continually expected to grow:
        service robotics market is projected to grow from 36.2 billion USD (2021) to 103.3 billion USD by 2026. <br>
        As such, I found it important that the interactional aspects between robots and humans needed to progress
        alongside the technological advacements. One of the main goal was to validate whether human body language was
        interpreted the same way if a humanoid robot was to display such gestures and whether the two main categories of
        body language, open and closed, influenced the perception of social qualities in the humanoid robot. </p>

    <h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
    In social interactions, much of what we verbally communicate is supported by nonverbal cues (i.e., gestures,body
    language, voice tone, facial expressions). Body language, in particular, acts as an intermediary between an
    individual’s emotions and the behavioral outcome providing information about the producer’s emotional state and
    their action intentions. Warmth and competence compose the two basic dimensions of social perception put forth by
    the Stereotype Content Model. SCM posits that when individuals first meet others, they judge others based on
    perceptions of warmth and competence to get a scope of their intentions and capability. These judgments elicit four
    distinct emotional responses resulting from combinations of high vs. low warmth and competence. Each emotional
    response as proposed in the SCM is associated with two behavioral tendencies, which are proposed in the Behaviors
    from Intergroup Affect and Stereotypes (BIAS) map. The BIAS map made predictions of behavioral tendencies based on
    the judgments of warmth and competence: active facilitation, active harm, passive facilitation, and passive harm.

    <h1>Experiment 1</h1>

    <p>Experiment 1 aimed to explore the effects of body language alone on the perception of social qualities of NAO.
        Two videos containing a closed body (contractive) gesturing robot and an open body (expansive) gesturing robot
        in random order were used in the experiment. Each video was approximately one minute long, which consisted of
        eight gestures and a second pause with a black screen between each gesture: hello, pose, question, suggestion,
        one-handed question, exclamation, yes, and no.
    </p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p> Two videos containing a closed body (contractive) gesturing robot and an open body (expansive) gesturing robot
        in random order were used in the experiment. Each video was approximately one minute long, which consisted of
        eight gestures and a second pause with a black screen between each gesture: hello, pose, question, suggestion,
        one-handed question, exclamation, yes, and no.</p>

    <h3>Participants</h3>
    <p>58 individuals from the undergraduate pool from Seoul National University were recruited.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>

    <p>The results of the experiment suggest that gestures that convey certain body language alone affect the perception
        of social qualities and human-likeness of NAO. The current study provides evidence that people form robots’
        impressions of warmth and competence similar to forming impressions of other individuals. Another goal of this
        study was to assess whether the different body language affected the perception of human-likeness of NAO. While
        there was a significant difference between anthropomorphism, animacy, likeability, no significant difference was
        observed in perceived intelligence and perceived safety. </p>


    <h1>Experiment 2</h1>
    <p>The main objective of experiment 2 was to replicate the findings from experiment 1 and applying the same body
        language to social interaction. Although gestures conveying a certain body language shows that it affects the
        way NAO is perceived, it does not seem fully convincing, considering that no interaction took place. To further
        demonstrate that body language affects perceptions of social qualities and human-likeness, I applied the
        gestures from experiment 1 to a more natural social setting.</p>

    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <p>The procedure for experiment 2 closely mirrored experiment 1 in that participants were to view a video and then
        rate their perception of NAO. The primary difference was the inclusion of no body language condition on top of
        closed, and open body language conditions. The videos in experiment 2 entailed a full social interaction between
        a person and NAO with dialogues. In addition, participants’ personality was measured before viewing the video to
        probe whether participants’ personality correlated with increased preference for a certain body language. The
        interaction consisted of the following: a game of charades (i.e., acting out an elephant, gorilla, and mouse)
        followed by a Q&A session then a picture taking session which resulted in 5-minute videos. </p>

    <h3>Internal Usability Test</h3>
    <p>Before running the experiment, I recruited 3 internal participants to test whether the social interaction
        scenarios that were programmed felt natural.
    </p>

    <h3>Participants</h3>
    <p>119 individuals from the undergraduate pool from Seoul National University were recruited. Participants were
        randomly assigned to either open body language (N = 34), closed body language (N = 42), or static condition (N =
        45).</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The effects present in experiment 1 did not carry over to experiment 2, where social interaction took place in
        the video. This suggests that other factors other than body language play significant roles in perceptions of
        social qualities and human-likeness during social interactions. </p>

    <h2>Implications</h2>
